== Net::LDAP 0.0.1: May 1, 2006

  from the community.
* We're internally working on a Ruby-based implementation
  of a full-featured, production-quality LDAP server,
  which will leverage the underlying LDAP and BER functionality
  in Net::LDAP.
* Please tell us if you would be interested in seeing a public
  release of the LDAP server.
* Grateful acknowledgement to Austin Ziegler, who reviewed
  this code and provided the release framework, including
  minitar.
