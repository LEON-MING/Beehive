class Solr::Response::Dismax < Solr::Response::Standard
  ***REMOVED*** no need for special processing
  
  ***REMOVED*** FIXME: 2007-02-07 <coda.hale@gmail.com> --  The existence of this class indicates that
  ***REMOVED*** the Request/Response pair architecture is a little hinky. Perhaps we could refactor
  ***REMOVED*** out some of the most common functionality -- Common Query Parameters, Highlighting Parameters,
  ***REMOVED*** Simple Facet Parameters, etc. -- into modules?
