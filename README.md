# Beehive
## UC Berkeley

-------------

Beehive is an open source web application written in Rails 4 designed
to facilitate the matching of students (in particular, but not necessarily,
undergraduate students) to research positions offered by faculty at
university. Beehive uses tags and user-specified parameters to
suggest research positions for students, manages the application to jobs
by students and allows for the submission of a resume and/or transcript
in the research application.

Starting in Spring 2018, Beehive has reentered active development under the care of the **Associated Students of the University of California's Office of the CTO** ([ASUC OCTO](http://asucocto.org/)).

Please contact OCTO if you have any questions, queries, or concerns.
