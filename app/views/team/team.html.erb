    <h3>Story</h3>
    <p>
      Beehive is an open-source project originally sponsored by the College of Engineering. It was started as a CS 169 (then CS 194-4) project in Fall 2009 under Prof. Armando Fox. Currently, Beehive is being developed by students in the <a href="http://asucocto.org" target="_blank">ASUC Office of the CTO</a>, and its <a href="https://github.com/asuc-octo/Beehive" target="_blank">source code</a> is available for public perusal.
    </p>
    <h3>Vision</h3>
    <p>
  		As a year-round, student-run platform for undergraduate research at Berkeley, we aim to fill the gaps left behind by existing programs like URAP and SURF, which typically provide opportunities on a cyclical basis and have dedicated administrative staff. Beehive is especially valuable for faculty and graduate student researchers who wish to recruit undergraduates for <b>summer, short-term, or otherwise off-cycle</b> projects (e.g. after the URAP deadline). As part of our collaboration with student representatives in the ASUC, we hope to encourage higher undergraduate participation in academic research.
